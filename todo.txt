SHORT TERM

1. Add support for minimum length of parent_spans.
     -currently, parent_span is only using the built in children of a token's
      head. However, this sometimes results in very short spans with little to
      no useful information in the span. This can be fixed by instituting a
      minimum length for parent spans and widening the parent span search based
      on that minimum length.

LONG TERM

1. Write pandas pipeline for feeding dataframes to NLP pipeline.
